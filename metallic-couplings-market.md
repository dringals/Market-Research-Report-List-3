<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chain</li><li>Gear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metallic couplings are available in various types, with two common types being chain couplings and gear couplings. Chain couplings feature two sprockets connected by a roller chain, providing flexibility and shock absorption. They are commonly used in applications with high torque and misalignment. Gear couplings use gears to transmit torque, offering higher torque capacity and precision compared to chain couplings. They are often used in heavy-duty industrial applications where precise power transmission is required. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining efficiency and reliability in machinery.</p></p>
