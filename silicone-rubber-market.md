<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Temperature Vulcanization(HTV)</li><li>Room Temperature Vulcanization(RTV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicone rubber can be classified into two main types based on the vulcanization process involved - High Temperature Vulcanization (HTV) and Room Temperature Vulcanization (RTV). HTV silicone rubber is processed at high temperatures, resulting in a durable and heat-resistant material suitable for applications requiring high temperature resistance. On the other hand, RTV silicone rubber is cured at room temperature, making it easier to work with and ideal for applications where heat may damage the material during processing.</p></p>
