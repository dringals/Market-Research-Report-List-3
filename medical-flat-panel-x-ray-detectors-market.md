<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical flat panel X-ray detectors are classified into two types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use scintillator material to convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then converted into an electrical signal. Direct conversion detectors, on the other hand, directly convert X-ray photons into an electronic signal without the need for a scintillator. Both types of detectors have their own advantages and disadvantages, and their adoption in the market depends on factors such as image quality, cost, and efficiency.</p></p>
