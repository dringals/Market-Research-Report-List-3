<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Pneumatic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear pneumatic cylinder market can be categorized into two types: double acting and single acting. Double acting cylinders use air pressure to extend and retract the piston, providing force in both directions. Single acting cylinders, on the other hand, use air pressure to extend the piston, but rely on an external force (spring or gravity) to retract it. Both types are widely used in various industrial applications due to their efficiency and reliability in generating linear motion.</p></p>
