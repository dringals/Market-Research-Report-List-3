<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mold Release Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Mold Releases</li><li>External Mold Releases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Internal mold releases are coatings applied directly to the mold to prevent the molded part from sticking to the mold surface. These coatings are typically silicone-based and provide a barrier between the mold and the part being molded. External mold releases, on the other hand, are coatings applied directly to the part being molded to prevent it from sticking to the mold. These coatings are usually wax-based and help in easy release of the part from the mold. Both types of coatings are essential in the manufacturing process to ensure smooth and efficient molding operations.</p></p>
