<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Textile Antistatic Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anion</li><li>Cation</li><li>Zwitterion</li><li>Nonionic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Textile antistatic agents can be classified into four main types based on their ionic charge: anion, cation, zwitterion, and nonionic. Anion antistatic agents are negatively charged and work by neutralizing positively charged particles on the fabric surface. Cation antistatic agents are positively charged and function by neutralizing negatively charged particles. Zwitterion antistatic agents possess both positive and negative charges, providing a balanced approach to static dissipation. Nonionic antistatic agents have no ionic charge and work by creating a thin film on the fabric surface to prevent static buildup.</p></p>
