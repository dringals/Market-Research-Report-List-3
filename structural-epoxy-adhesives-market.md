<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Epoxy Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-component</li><li>Two-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Structural epoxy adhesives are widely classified into two types based on their composition and application method: one-component and two-component adhesives. One-component adhesives are pre-mixed and ready to use, making them convenient for quick bonding tasks. On the other hand, two-component adhesives require mixing of separate resin and hardener components before application, allowing for precise control over curing times and bond strength. Both types offer high strength, durability, and resistance to environmental factors, catering to a wide range of industrial and construction applications.</p></p>
