<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymeric Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Adhesive</li><li>Thermoplastic Adhesive</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymeric adhesives can be categorized into three main types: thermosetting adhesives, thermoplastic adhesives, and others. Thermosetting adhesives are cured through a chemical reaction that creates a permanent bond, making them more heat and chemical resistant. Thermoplastic adhesives soften when exposed to heat and harden as they cool, allowing for repositioning before the bond becomes permanent. The "others" category includes specialty adhesives like pressure-sensitive adhesives, radiation-curable adhesives, and hybrid adhesives that do not fit neatly into the thermosetting or thermoplastic categories.</p></p>
