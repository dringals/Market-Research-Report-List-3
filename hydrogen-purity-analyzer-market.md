<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Purity Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion-proof</li><li>Not Explosion-proof</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hydrogen Purity Analyzer market includes two main types: Explosion-proof and Not Explosion-proof. Explosion-proof analyzers are designed to operate safely in hazardous environments where there is a risk of explosion. These analyzers are built with robust safety features to prevent any potential ignition source. On the other hand, Not Explosion-proof analyzers are suitable for regular industrial environments without the need for additional safety measures. Both types of analyzers serve the same purpose of measuring hydrogen purity, but the Explosion-proof ones are specially designed for high-risk environments.</p></p>
